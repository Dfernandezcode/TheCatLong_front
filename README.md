# Sports Ecommerce Website - TheCatLong.

Done in collaboration between Alex Brasoveanu Jurado, Fernando Molero Martin and Daniel Fernandez

## Project Description:

In order to continue expanding our understanding and knowledge of real projects this ecommerce website was built to be a functional sports retail store similar to Decathlon and other online outlets. It aims to organize products from multiple categories into a cohesive storefront with a focus on clean, easy to navigate UI and a smooth intuitive user experience from landing to checkout.

## Initial Design:

### Landing

The website landing had some key objectives.

- A navbar that allowed users to login.
- A favourites section allowing users to bookmark products for potential future purchases.
- A clear search bar to easily find and navigate products.
- A landing banner/image for advertising products/company.
- A hamburger menu to condense links such as filters, categories, contact page and other secondary links.

### Card design

Using various websites as reference, a simple initial design was created with a focus on presenting inforamtion through the use of cards laid out in a grid. Initial designs wanted to present as much information to the user as possible. However after testing and consideration changes were made to split the card into a simple, key information only preview cards which the user can click which brings up an overlay of a more detailed product presentation.

## Liberaries Used:

### Animation:

Framer-motion was used to create smooth transitions between clicks and pages.

### Language Toggle

In order to implement multiple language support the library "react-intl" was used allowing us to have the website be accessible in English, Spanish and allows for further future implementation of languages as needed.
